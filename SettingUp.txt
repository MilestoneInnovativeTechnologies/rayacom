Step by step procedure to setup development environment..

CMD with Admin Privilege
Goto D:\htdocs\InventoryProject
laravel New <ProjName>
Ex: laravel New RayaFir

Open file C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Add a line
	127.0.0.1       raya<name>
Ex:
	127.0.0.1       rayafir
Save file

Open file C:\Program Files\Apache24\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf

	ServerName raya<name>
    DocumentRoot "D:/htdocs/InventoryProject/<ProjName>/public"
</VirtualHost>
Ex:
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName rayafir
    DocumentRoot "D:/htdocs/InventoryProject/RayaFir/public"
</VirtualHost>

restart apache server
httpd -k restart

visit http://raya<name> using browser, Ex: http://rayafir
If laravel page views properly, Laravel setup is completed..

=====================================================

Using cmd
Get into the laravel project folder
Ex: D:\htdocs\InventoryProject\RayaFir
create folder milestone, and get into it, then clone project files from repository
mkdir milestone
cd milestone
git clone https://github.com/MilestoneInnovativeTechnologies/rayacom.git

Add to laravel root composer.json
autoload
	"files": ["milestone/rayacom/helpers.php"]
autoload > psr-4
	"Milestone\\Rayacom\\": "milestone/rayacom/src/"

Add to config > app > providers
	\Milestone\Rayacom\RayacomServiceProvider::class,

Correct config > app > timezone Ex: Asia/Kolkata
Create Database and set details in env file
Run from root laravel project folder
composer dump-autoload
php artisan migrate:fresh


If need dummy data, then copy data files to storage > app, then run
php artisan db:seed --class=Milestone\Rayacom\Seeders\DatabaseSeeder

=====================================================

run
php artisan vendor:publish --force
then enter number corresponding to RayacomServiceProvider from the list

run
npm install
for installing node modules

npm run dev
for starting dev server. Please note the port number from console. Set this port number in env file as
DEV_PORT=<port>
Ex: DEV_PORT=9000
If env have these variable set, then application will be in developer mode, else it will be in production mode

for building assets (production), run
npm run build

=====================================================

Publishing Assets - Different methods
php artisan vendor:publish --force
rayacom-install: All required files for starting development using quasar.. Quasar source files and package.json files and dummy data files.. No need to do publish frequently.
rayacom-resources: All required files for starting development using quasar.. Quasar source files and package.json files..  No need to do publish frequently. Publish only when github updated and needed the source codes changes, but not compiled assets
rayacom-updates: All assets and public files.. This need to be published when github updated, or whenever new updates published.
rayacom-dev-updates: All assets, public, data and resource files.. This need to be published whenever any updates pushed by any developer.
rayacom-data: Wherever there is a change in dummy data, this need to be run.

=====================================================

Shifting between development and production..
When appending the browser url with port number, it will be shifted to development
Please note, development will be available only if npm run dev should be called and its running..
If no port appended, or serving on port 80, then production assets will be used and served...

=====================================================

When building,All the source files of package will be updated..
Initially deleted every files and folders from package's public/assets and all files from public
Then copies every files from dist/spa to package's public folder (except index.html)[Which is not required there as index page serves from laravel view]
After that, quasar src folder files will be copied to package's install/src..
Once this done, extracts js and css file names from dist/spa/index.html and stores as assets.json in packages public/assets
Finally, package's public folder will be copied to laravel's public folder
